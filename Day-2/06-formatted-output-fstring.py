name = "Josh"
score = 5

print("Hello " + name + ", Your score is " + str(score) + ".")

# Doing type conversion for displaying ouput everytime is very time consuming
# so, python provides formatted output : fstring

print(f"Hello {name}, Your score is {score}.")

# Code is lesser and less error prone
