# variables are like container in memory
# they are used to store user input data
# or other data in programs, for later use

name = input("Whats your name: ")
print("Your name is " + name)

bYear = input("Whats your birth year: ")
print("Your birth year is " + bYear)

# Variable Naming Rules
# 1. Must Have Meaningful Name
# 2. You can have multiple words for variable, but must be one single unit
# 3. Variable names cannot be separated by spaces, however underscore '_' can be used
# 4. You can use numbers in variables as along as variable names do not start from them
# 5. Python keywords like print,input... cannot be used as variable names

# You don't need to worry too much about variable names as modern IDEs 
# will show you error message if you by mistake have not followed the rules
