# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Nov 11, 2020 (Working with Variables)

##### (user input, variables, string concatenation)

**Today's Progress:** Learnt about printing to console, taking user input, performing string concatenation, storing data in variables.

**Thoughts:** Although I am fairly advanced in python, I started from the scratch as i have been doing A lot of Web(JS,CSS) and C++ lately and haven't touched python for about 6 months. My plan is to
brush up on and learn Python parallely with JS,CSS,React and C++.

### Day 2: Nov 12, 2020 (Working with Data)

##### (data types, operations, formatting output)

**Today's Progress:** Learnt about primitive data types, math operations, output formatting and did few projects.

**Thoughts:** Although i knew about most of these stuffs, formatted output in python was new to me. Learnt something new today and C++ is going good too. I have halted doing web for now.
